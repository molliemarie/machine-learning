    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Logistic models can be updated easily with new data using stochastic gradient descent.\"\n",
    "    - \"The models themselves are still \"linear,\" so they work well when your classes are linearly separable (i.e. they can be separated by a single decision surface).\"\n",
    "    - \"Logistic regression can also be regularized by penalizing coefficients with a tunable penalty strength.\"\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "    - Also according to [this article](https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms), \"Logistic regression tends to underperform when there are multiple or non-linear decision boundaries. They are not flexible enough to naturally capture more complex relationships.\"\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "    - Logistic regression is a pretty good (albeit simple) model for problems like this, where we have two categorical outcomes to choose from, which is why I chose this model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "    - [This article](http://what-when-how.com/artificial-intelligence/decision-tree-applications-for-data-modelling-artificial-intelligence/) details a customer relationship management use-case:\n",
    "    - \"A frequently used approach to manage customers’ relationships is to investigate how individuals access online services. Such an investigation is mainly performed by collecting and analyzing individuals’ usage data and then providing recommendations based on the extracted information. Lee et al. (2007) apply decision trees to investigate the relationships between the customers’ needs and preferences and the success of online shopping. In their study, the frequency of using online shopping is used as a label to classify users into two categories: (a) users who rarely used online shopping and (b) users who frequently used online shopping. In terms of the former, the model suggests that the time customers need to spend in a transaction and how urgent customers need to purchase a product are the most important factors which need to be considered. With respect to the latter, the created model indicates that price and the degree of human resources involved (e.g. the requirements of contacts with the employees of the company in having services) are the most important factors. The created decision trees also suggest that the success of an online shopping highly depends on the frequency of customers’ purchases and the price of the products. Findings discovered by decision trees are useful for understanding their customers’ needs and preferences.\"\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "    - According to [this article](http://www.simafore.com/blog/bid/62333/4-key-advantages-of-using-decision-trees-for-predictive-analytics), \"Decision trees implicitly perform variable screening or feature selection\"\n",
    "    - \"Decision trees require relatively little effort from users for data preparation\"\n",
    "    - \"Nonlinear relationships between parameters do not affect tree performance\"\n",
    "    - \"easy to interpret and explain to executives!\"\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "    - They are prone to overfitting, unless hyperparameters and limitations are carefully selected.\n",
    "    - \"They can be extremely sensitive to small perturbations in the data: a slight change can result in a drastically different tree.\"\n",
    "    - \"They can have problems out-of-sample prediction (this is related to them being non-smooth).\"\n",
    "    - Last two bullets from [this post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/1292/what-is-the-weak-side-of-decision-trees). (Technically, the first one is in there, too, but I'd already written out that one. :p )\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "    - Due to it's splitting nature, decision trees are also good for categorial outcomes.\n",

    "The main gist of logistic regression is that it estimates the probability of an event occuring given previous data. Logistic regression are concerned with categorical values (e.g. yes or no, heads or tails, etc) and help us predict the likelihood of each of these events. We basically want to know that odds that one thing will happen over another.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical example of something like would be estimating whether or not a person is likely to pay back a loan (something a lender would want to know before agreeing to pay out a loan to a potential borrower). A simple model could look at things like credit scores and loan amount in calculating this estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In training this model, one would input data points from past borrowers. This data would include their credit score, the loan amount, and whether or not they paid off their loan in a timely manner (1 for yes, 0 for no). Using this data, a model is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "A visual representation of this model would look like the drawing below, where the x axis represents some combination of the input data (credit score and loan amount) the y axis is the probability that a person would pay back a loan. You can think of that line as being a visual representation of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/logistic.jpg\" width=\"400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can go a bit further and divide this plot up into two - any point with a probability value below 0.5 is assumed to be associated with a person who WILL NOT pay back their loan, and any point with a probability value 0.5 and above is assumed to be associated with a person who WILL pay back their loan. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/logistic2.jpg\" width=\"400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a prediction, one would input the credit score and loan amount into the model and it would output some number between 0 (you're absolutely sure a person won't pay back the loan) and 1 (you're absolutely sure a person will pay back the loan). \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a visual example of this. You can start with where the first borrower falls on the line (which would be based on their credit score and loan amount). Then, trace up to the logistic regression line. You'll see that this falls somewhere between 0 and 0.1 on the y axis, which is below 0.5; therefore, this person will likely not pay back their loan.\n",
    "\n",

    "Next, we'll try with a second borrower, tracing up to the logistic regression line. You'll see that this falls closer to 1 on the y axis. Therefore this person will likey pay back their loan. \n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
